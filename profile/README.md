# Welcome to the Mumbai Flood

We are a team of students, faculty, and staff from the Interdisciplinary Programme in Climate Studies (IDPCS) at IIT Bombay. Our mission is to develop an experimental rainfall forecasting and flood monitoring system to help Mumbai adapt to its persistent monsoon flooding.

## About the Project

Through a dedicated website portal [https://www.mumbaiflood.in/](https://www.mumbaiflood.in/) and the **Mumbai Flood App**, we aim to disseminate near-real-time rainfall and waterlogging information. By providing timely and accurate rainfall forecasts and flood updates, we empower Mumbaikars to plan their rain days better.

### Key Features

#### 1. **Experimental Rainfall Forecasts**
Our hyperlocal rainfall forecasts are derived from global forecasting systems (GFS) and enhanced using AI/ML modeling.
- **Rainfall Tab**: Displays hourly observed rainfall data (from MCGM) for the next 24 hours and daily forecasts for the subsequent three days at MCGM automatic weather stations (AWS).
- Visit the Rainfall tab for more details.

#### 2. **LIVE Water-Level Monitoring**
Nine water-level monitoring stations have been installed at flood-prone hotspots across Mumbai to provide near-real-time waterlogging updates during the monsoon.
- For details, visit the Water Level tab on the Home Page.

#### 3. **Reported Floods**
Help us track flooding by reporting water levels in your area:
- Fill out the form on the Reported Flood tab on the Home Page.

#### 4. **Rail**
This page provides near-real-time flooding information for various local rail stations in Mumbai.

#### 5. **Flood Sentiment Analysis (Tweets)**
We assess flood-related tweets using hashtags like `#MumbaiRains`:
- Sentiment analysis via machine learning gauges public mood as “positive” or “negative.”
- Tweets are geolocated using natural language processing (NLP)-based algorithms.

## Collaborators
This initiative is led by the **HDFC-ERGO IIT Bombay (HE-IITB) Innovation Lab**, with funding from **HDFC ERGO**, in collaboration with the **MCGM Centre for Municipal Capacity Building and Research (MCMCR)**.
